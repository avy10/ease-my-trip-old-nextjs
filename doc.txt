responsiveness is coded at the end of creation of each webpage and not at the end of project completion
all the css styling are present in the styles folder, with file name matching the page or component name

DEFAULT FILES OF /pages :
    pages -> index.jsx
    redirects to "/flights" because that is supposed to be the default home-page
    instead of router.push I am using router.replace. This makes sure the path "/" is removed from browser history. so when we try to go back from "/flights", we do not go back to "/" and get redirected again

pages -> \_app.jsx
    contains the layout for the entire app
    the purpose is to render the Navigation and Footer on all the webpages
    the entire App is wrapped by Authorisation Context Provider
    due to next.js rules, all the css are being imported here

CONTEXT PROVIDERS 
    1. AUTHORISATION CONTEXT PROVIDER
        contains the isLoggedIn state and function to set it to true

        future requirements:
            - because I can toggle this state to true or false on inspecting, a check needs to be performed
				whenever this state is updated a useEffect will run which will check for presence of JWT Bearer Token in the localstorage
					if JWT Bearer Token is not present, then isLoggedIn is set back to false again
				This JWT Bearer Token is provided to us by the newton-API. This token will be used by the POST-method to perform booking actions

			- store the JWT Bearer Token in localstorage on login, clear the JWT Bearer Token from localstorage on logout

	2. FLIGHT SEARCH CONTEXT

		FlightSearchContext only wraps the "/flights" section of the app
		THE PURPOSE IS THAT EACH SECTION TO HAVE ITS OWN CONTEXT, WHICH MAKES DATA HANDLING EASIER

		It contains state that is required to perform the flight-search
			source => default value is Delhi Airport
			destination => default value is Mumbai Airport
			day => defaults to current day using dayjs()
			returnDay => defaults to current day using dayjs()
			numberOfPassengers => default is 1
			isTwoWay => default is false
				checks if the user is booking a return trip, 
				the target page for one-way flights page and two-way flights are different on purpose
				it makes designing of webpage easier
		
		Functions to update the state conditionally
			updateFlightSearchStates
			updateTwoWay
			updateDay

	BREIF DESCRIPTION

		0. components\discarded
			contains any older component which is no longer in use
		
		1. components\Custom-MUI-Components
			contains MUI-components that has been customised to cater the design needs of this project
		
		2. components\Custom-User-Components
			contains any re-usable custom component
		3. components\Flights
			contains components for "/flights" route
		4. components\Navigation.jsx

	DETAILS
		4. components\Navigation.jsx
			this component contains the Navigation section of the entire App
			Logo -- Navigation Tabs -- User Access
			!! UPDATED !!on Scroll size of the component is reduced which is achieved by conditional rendering of MiniPageNavigation
				~ Instead of conditionally rendering a different component altogether, I am simply conditionally rendering the name of the navigation Tabs
				~ window has an EventListener which sets the state scrollLengthY true when scroll length is >= 40 indicating the user has scrolled vertically down 
				and false, when user has scrolled up
				
				~ Earlier => there were two different components being rendered based on setScrollLengthY state
				~ In the UPDATE => the name div.nav-text will be rendered conditionally based on the setScrollLengthY state. this removes the use of MiniPageNavigation component altogether

			without the div.blank-space the name of the navigation links appears on top of image
			it is a hackey way of rendering the name of navigation link below the icons
			Most probably this could have been achieved by using position, but creating this blank div was a hackey attempt
